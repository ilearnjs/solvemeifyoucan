# Solve Me If You Can

* Route / should redirect to /universal

Make it so that:
* Route /universal is a SSR loaded page (Universal).
* Route /spa is only rendered on client side (SPA).

On page load (refreshing the page):
* The number in the store should be increased by 1, by calling the addNumber action in store/count.js.
* Make sure the number is always 1. Both if you refresh the page on /universal and on /spa

> Focus on a clean, scaleable solution. The quality of your code is as important as the solution.
> This challenge should take you no longer than 1-2 hours, otherwise it's unlikely this position is for you.
